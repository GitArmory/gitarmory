However, this approach often leaves security and compliance behind due to the accelerated pace and ephemeral nature of cloud resources. To overcome this false choice between exposing the organization to risk or slowing down development, modern governance provides continuously audited and verified policies. By implementing modern governance, organizations can go faster and safer without compromising security and compliance."
